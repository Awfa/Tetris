# Tetris
This is a recreation of Tetris for my high school's senior project. This is my first Java project and was used as a goal for me to learn Java.

## Features
 - Every Tetris feature is implemented except T-Spins
 - Volume control in the options screen
 - Pause menu
 - Particle effects when lines are cleared
 - Message flybys when you get double/triple/tetris/back2back clears!
